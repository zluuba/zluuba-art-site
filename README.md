## Big Plans

.art is not just a nice GTLD, it's the purpose of the website.  
So I want to make it right and rebuild the current website into a beautiful piece of art.

Functionality:
- admin panel for blog posts (markdown and html support);
- statistic logging;

Design:
- two color schemes: #f2f2f2 and #5c5c5c, aka soft cake cream and graphite;
- line-like glass main menu with the logo on the left and items section on the right (projects, blog, contact);
- add patterns and colors (not too much, not too colorful);

DevOps:
- bash script for SSL recreation (3 mos. circle);
- tools for quick deployment (including fast updates);

Tools:
- try HTMX;
